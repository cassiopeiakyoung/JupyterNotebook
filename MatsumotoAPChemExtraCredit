Hello all who may be reading this file (i.e. everyone in Mr. Matsumoto's 4th period 2018-2019 AP Chemistry class).

I initially said that I would post the answers on my github, as in code snippets.

However, I am efficient.

At the bottom of this file is the link to my Google Colab file, with every exercise completed accurately. 

I urge any of you reading this to attempt to complete the exercises on your own initially, without referring to this or copying
directly from my Google Colab file. In fact, you can't copy directly from it - I have disabled that feature - unless you were
to painstakingly copy it manually, character for character. Think of this file as the answers on the back of Precalc Honors/AP
Calc homework. You are meant to do this yourself, and of course you are free to simply copy. However, simply copying means you
will not learn and thus will not be able to earn more potential points by integrating the Python code into your future lab
reports. If you can't do it, don't be discouraged! It took me quite a while to finish all the exercises. Remember the parable of
the butterfly.

P.S. It took me about an hour to finish. Try to beat my time (without copying!) for a gold star!
